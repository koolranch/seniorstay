## Technical Details

### Scraping Method
Used Firecrawl MCP tool with the following priority for image discovery:
1. `og:image` (Open Graph) meta tag
2. Hero images in page header/banner
3. First high-resolution image in content
4. `branding` format extraction
5. JSON config embedded images (TalkFurther widgets)

### Image Formats Discovered
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg` - 9 images
- `.png` - 4 images  
- `.webp` - 2 images
- CDN URLs with format parameters - 1 image

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Rocky River Village** - Website DNS resolution failed. Found alternative on Caring.com.
2. **Lantern of Chagrin Valley** - No website URL in database. Found via search on Elder Life Financial.
3. **Wiggins Place** - Original website minimal. Found gallery on Jewish Care Guide.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Action Required
Run the SQL script to update Supabase:

```bash
# Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard
# Go to SQL Editor and paste contents of:
# scripts/update-priority-community-images.sql

# Option 2: Via Supabase CLI
supabase db execute --file scripts/update-priority-community-images.sql
```

### Recommended Follow-up
1. **Verify image loading** - Check each community page renders the new image
2. **Image optimization** - Consider running images through an optimizer for WebP conversion
3. **CDN caching** - Monitor for any broken CDN links over time
4. **Ongoing audit** - Schedule monthly checks for new communities without images
